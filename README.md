Methodology:
The project will utilize a combination of quantitative data collection methods (surveys, attendance records analysis) and qualitative approaches (interviews, focus groups) to gather comprehensive insights. Data analysis will involve statistical tools and visualizations to identify patterns and trends.

Significance:
Understanding these patterns is crucial for designing targeted interventions to improve school retention and ensure equitable access to quality education for all refugee children and youth in Kakuma. The findings will support stakeholders, including educational authorities, NGOs, and community leaders, in developing sustainable solutions to enhance educational outcomes in the camp.
